## Description

As a new web developer, this porfolio serves as a place not only to share my projects as I'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share my work with other developers and collaborate on future projects.

This mobile-first, single page application was designed using React and Ant Design. For future builds I hope to incorporate animation and build out a basic backend structure for handling email and booking forms.

## Installation

First clone the repository. Install all dependencies using 'npm i' in the command terminal, and run the code using 'npm run start'.
